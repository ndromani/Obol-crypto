# Pearl River Commons & Obol-crypto: Project for the distribute economies workshop with Akasha
## A Community & a Cryptocurrency for River Remediation
The Commons aims to preserve the Pearl River by rewarding positive ecological work with Obol tokens that increase in value as the environment improves. Obol refers to the name of the coins given to Charon, who would ferry souls across the River Styx in Greek mythology.
The work done to increase the health of a commons backs the tokens.

# How it works

![](/images/DOC_measurement.jpg "This is the sensor of the DOC content in water")


Real-time measurement of the **Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)** content in the river water

Several DOC sensors would run along the river, storing data on a blockchain

Formula: **$1 = (Local DOC ÷ Healthy DOC) Obol tokens**

Health DOC = 5; if local DOC is 12 then $1 =  Local DOC/5 = 12/5 = 2.4 Obol tokens; **1000 tokens → 1000/2.4 = $417**

If local DOC diminishes to 8, through the work done to increase the health of the river, then  $1 =  Local DOC/5 = 8/5 = 1,6 Obol tokens ; **1000 tokens → 1000/2.4 = $625**
