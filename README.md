# Pearl River Commons & Obol-crypto: Project for the distribute economies workshop with Akasha
## A Community & a Cryptocurrency for River Remediation
The Commons aims to preserve the Pearl River by rewarding positive ecological work with Obol tokens that increase in value as the environment improves. Obol refers to the name of the coins given to Charon, who would ferry souls across the River Styx in Greek mythology.
The work done to increase the health of a commons backs the tokens.
